## Getting Started

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Install the template

Run the command in your Terminal to initialize this template on your local computer.

See the documentation if you are [having issues with the CLI](https://www.sanity.io/help/cli-errors).

```shell
npm create sanity@latest -- --template sanity-io/sanity-template-nextjs-clean
```

#### 2. Run Studio and Next.js app locally

Navigate to the template directory using `cd <your app name>`, and start the development servers by running the following command

```shell
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Log in to the Studio

Open the Next.js app running locally in your browser on http://localhost:3000.

Open the Studio running locally in your browser on http://localhost:3333.

You should now see a screen prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used when you logged in to the CLI.

### Adding content with Sanity

The template comes pre-defined with a schema containg `Page`, `Post`, `Person`, and `Settings` document types.

#### Publish your first document

From the Studio, click "+ Create" and select the `Post` document type. Go ahead and create and publish the document.

Your content should now appear on your Next.js app ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) as well as in the Studio on the "Presentation" Tab

#### Extending the Sanity schema

The schema for the `Post` document type is defined in the `studio/src/schemaTypes` folder. You can [add more document types](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types) to the schema to suit your needs.

### Deploying your application and inviting editors

Your Next.js frontend (`/nextjs-app`) and Sanity Studio (`/studio`) are still only running on your local computer. It's time to deploy and get it into the hands of other content editors.

#### Deploy the Sanity Studio

Back in your Studio directory (`/studio`) run the following command to deploy your Sanity Studio.

```shell
npx sanity deploy
```

#### How to deploy your Next.js app to Vercel

You have the freedom to deploy your Next.js app to your hosting provider of choice. With Vercel and GitHub being a popular choice, we'll cover the basics of that approach.

1. Create a GitHub repository from this project. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
2. Create a new Vercel project and connect it to your Github repository.
3. Set the `Root Directory` to your Next.js app.
4. Configure your Environment Variables.

There are other ways deploy your app to Vercel without setting up a GitHub repository, but we won't be covering them. Reference the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) for more information.

#### Invite a collaborator

Now that you’ve deployed your Next.js application and Sanity Studio, you can optionally invite a collaborator to your Studio. Open up [Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select your project and click "Invite project members"

They will be able to access the deployed Studio, where you can collaborate together on creating content.

### Import Demo Data _(optional)_

You may want to start with some sample content and we've got you covered. Run this command to import the provided dataset (demoData.tar.gz) into your Sanity project. This step is optional but can be helpful for getting started quickly.

```shell
npx sanity dataset import demoData.tar.gz <your dataset name>
```
